# ZyboZ6-Analog-Joystick
An attempt to make a 2-axis analog joystick work on the Zybo Z6

## Materials 
1. Zybo Z6 FPGA Development board [XC7Z010-1CLG400C](https://digilent.com/reference/_media/reference/programmable-logic/zybo/zybo_rm.pdf)
2. 2-axis analog joystick
	- Model shouldn't matter, but I'm using one from [Parallax](https://www.parallax.com/product/2-axis-joystick/)
	- I also recommend the analog joystick breakout kit from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/512)
